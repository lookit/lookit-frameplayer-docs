            <ul>
            <li>
            The <b>frames</b> are available frame types to use in Lookit studies - like
            instructions pages or looking-time trials. The documentation will tell you
            how each frame works and what parameters you need to give it.
            </li>

            <li>
            The <b>randomizers</b> are used to set up counterbalancing or condition
            assignment. The randomizers described here correspond to values for 'sampler'
            when you define a frame with type 'choice'. The documentation will tell you
            how each randomizer works and what parameters you need to give it.
            </li>

            <li>
            The <b>mixins</b> and <b>services</b> are not relevant unless you are creating your own frames.
            </li>

            <li>
            These are the docs for particular frames - they are autogenerated from comments
            in the source code.
            For more general (and readable) information on how to define and test your Lookit study, please
            see the <a href="https://lookit.readthedocs.io">Lookit docs</a>.
